    <h2>Frenchy or Stud</h2>
    <p>Hi I am Ethan French, going into economics for my career. Learning the insides and outs of the stock market,
        being finicailly prepared for crashes, to grow an online economy, and improve ours that is struggleing. My
        hobbies is reading business/self improvement books (this will also help me in economics), am a super active
        character, love to workout 3-4 times out of the week. I have currently in a job, doing beekeeping and will soon
        be doing another for a side hustle that will help with my career. Being a big learner, I have always seen the
        success pay off, only if you put the mind to a challenge for that. There are so many wealthy people, not just
        talking about money, but characteristics, attributes, and life skills. There are many success stories out there,
        those people want others to succeed just like them, they are some big motivators. Some of them being within the
        Church, such as Alma or Moroni, they were such great leaders because of there processes of learning and being
        taught in life, with being tested first, then learning the lesson second. My goal is to become a better person
        within myself, working smart and on time has been a big part of it.</p>
